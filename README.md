As required I Built a React application with:

Redux
React Router
Styled Components
Material-UI
Create React App, Jest.

The application is to small to measure performance, that normally is done to catch up bottle neck and wasted time in re-render.
It possible to optimize performance throw React Pure Components, or instead with the life cycle method ShouldComponentUpdate,  Code Splitting and Virtualizing long list.
The Initial Load Times here is supplied with the Server Side Rendering.
There are no image to load ( could have an impact on browser performance ).
I added only few test, one for each component, to show how to test.
